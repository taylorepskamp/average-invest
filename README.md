## About

This project evolved out of my curiousity with dollar cost averaging. Obvjously it is a good idea invest continuously in order to achieve the average return for a particular stock, but I could not find comparisons of the actual timeframe. Was it better to invest once a month or every Monday? Was there an advantage to a particular day of the week? As it turns out there really isnt much difference among weekdays or even months.
